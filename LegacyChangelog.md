CHANGELOG:

Version 0.1.7.5
-Fixed docking port snap angles
-Added tags to cygnus

Version 0.1.7 (interim release)
-Fixed shader discolouration with KSP 1.1.0 full release and above
-Added an additional control to the solar arrays to allow toggling of rotation on both axes
-Tweaked solar array textures slightly (more realistic)
-Gave most parts specularity to some degree
-Added initial implementation of resource converters to science lab parts (extremely early dev)
-Added angle snap limit to CBM and truss docking ports so that parts will only dock at specific rotational increments, making construction/alignment easier

Version 0.1.6
-Replaced old IVAs with new, fancy IVAs. 
-Added option for using old simple IVAs for memory savings. 
-Added alternate Solar Array texture
-Added 1.875m truss part
-Added three different truss docking port parts

Version 0.1.5
-Added gigantic dual-axis sun-tracking solar array (still some issues e.g. missing colliders)
-Fixed misaligned IVA in JEM

Version 0.1.4
-Rescaled Cupola part to 1.25m
-Added 2.5m->1.25m structural adapters
-Added JEM laboratory
-Added Columbus laboratory
-Added Long Habitat module (based on proposed ISS module)
-Added MPLM part
-Added unique science experiments to each lab part (yet to be balanced)
-Added placeholder IVAs to all crewed parts so that cutaway view works correctly

Version 0.1.3
-Added four structural truss parts based on ISS Integrated Truss Structure
-Added 1.6m Cupola part

Version 0.1.2
-Added PMA structural part
-Added 0.937m shuttle/APAS docking port

Version 0.1.1 - 1.1 edition
-Added Z1 truss part.
-Added CLS support (dependent on CLS being updated for 1.1)
-Fixed parts for KSP 1.1.
-Added new science experiment for the Destiny lab module - 'Life Sciences'

Version 0.1.0 - Initial Alpha Release! 
-Added literally all of the parts so far.

FUTURE PLANS:
-More life support support support.
-More parts such as ESA lab, 1.875m cupola, truss/solar arrays from US ISS section.
-Science stuff.
-Integrate with CLS. 
-Long term: IVAs. 
-Make textures not be in .png format as soon as I can be bothered.
