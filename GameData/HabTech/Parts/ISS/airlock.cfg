	description = The QU-35T was developed in response to complaints that previous Unlimited Riveting Ltd. products had 'no way of getting out' and were 'vacuum-sealed death traps.' This small module is an ideal way of releasing crew-members into the deadly void of space for repair work/research/punishment for hitchhiking.
